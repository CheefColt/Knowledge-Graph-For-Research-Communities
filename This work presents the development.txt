With the proliferation of vast amounts of the data on the internet extracting meaningful information from huge database has become very challenging these days. This has led to the popularity of Knowledge Graphs (KG). KGs present a common base for generating knowledge through extraction of entities, relationships and analyzing them further. This work presents the development and implementation of a knowledge graph-based system for identifying and analyzing the relationships between different types of entities. For conducting this research, we have considered a dataset of scopus publications belonging to an organization. The system constructs a comprehensive collaboration network comprising of 4 different entities which include : Author name, paper title, year of publication, Journal/conference name. We have used extracted these entities and generated entity relationship pair using Natural Language Processing techniques. Further, we have generated different knowledge graphs (KG) which include author, paper and publication KG with limit as 20, KG with same set of entities and limit as 100, KG with year wise number of publications with respect to different conferences and KG showing existing communities working together under same umbrella. Also we have performed link prediction using different distance metrics which have given us the probability of formation of links between researchers who share similar publication patterns. The system demonstrates how graph database technology and network analysis algorithms can provide valuable insights into research community dynamics, facilitate link prediction discovery, and support strategic decision-making for researchers, academic institutions, and funding organizations seeking to understand and optimize academic collaboration networks. We can extend the same work by generating knowledge embeddings  from KGs which can be further used for model training using machine learning. We can generate such knowledge graphs real time using scopus APIs and extend our work.

(LIMIT 20) - shows the basic structure of how academic publishing works using three layers, Author, Paper, Journal Network (LIMIT 100) - is an expansion of the previous network offering a wider view of the academic world, keeping the same three main types of nodes but carrying more information, Community Detection (LIMIT 100) - a network of co-authorships that is modular, with clear separate groups of researchers who collaborate together, Community Detection (LIMIT 300) - shows a more complex structure where we can observe both tightly connected groups and loosely linked collaboration networks, with varying levels of connection between them, Paper and Publication Venue Network - reveals the publication landscape across multiple academic domains which act as key hubs that aggregate research from diverse sources, Year-wise Publication Paper count - shows the density distribution of papers across publication venues over 5 years.


All of these in Neo4j graph database, where authors, papers, and venues are represented as interconnected nodes. The implementation employs the Louvain algorithm for community detection, successfully identifying 847 research communities with a modularity score of 0.73, indicating strong organizational structure within the network. Additionally, a hybrid similarity-based approach combining Cosine and Jaccard metrics enables link prediction, identifying potential future link formation between researchers who share similar publication patterns. The system demonstrates how graph database technology and network analysis algorithms can provide valuable insights into research community dynamics, facilitate link prediction discovery, and support strategic decision-making for researchers, academic institutions, and funding organizations seeking to understand and optimize academic collaboration networks.
